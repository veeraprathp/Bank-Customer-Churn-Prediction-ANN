## Project Overview

This project utilizes an Artificial Neural Network (ANN) to predict whether bank customers will stay with the bank or leave (churn). The model is trained on a dataset of 10,000 customers, using various features such as demographic information, account details, and behavioral data.

## Dataset

The dataset comprises information on 10,000 bank customers, including the following features:

- **CustomerID**: Unique identifier for each customer
- **Geography**: Country of residence (France, Germany, Spain)
- **Gender**: Male or Female
- **Age**: Age of the customer
